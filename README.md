# sonicPainter
sonicPainter was my masters thesis project. It is a re-imagining of the traditional piano roll as a visual score space based on Xenakis' UPIC. Fundamentally, you create music by drawing and manipulating shapes rather than playing a single note.

sonicPainter was written in the Processing computer language which is based on Java.
